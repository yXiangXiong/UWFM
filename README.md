# Comprehensive breast ultrasound intelligence with an uncertainty weighting foundation model

We developed a foundation model for breast ultrasound analysis. We validate the effectiveness of our framework using extensive and diverse breast ultrasound datasets, including 964,363 images involved in upstream learning and 44,649 images involved in 9 downstream tasks. Across these validations, the framework consistently outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms in learning effective representations for breast ultrasound images and demonstrated strong performance on comprehensive downstream tasks without any pre-training.
